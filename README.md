goefa
=====

## Important:
There is [another fork](https://github.com/muesli/goefa), please take a look at that first, as I will try to port all features I added here to that fork in the future. 

package goefa implements a go (golang) client library to access data of public
transport companies which provide an EFA interface. You can search a stop, get
its next departures or request a trip.

## Installation
run

```bash
go get -v
```
to get 3rdparty libraries.

then run
```bash
go run examples/departure_monitor.go
```
to try the departure monitor example

## Usage
Simple example on how to verify a stop and get the departures:
```go
// create a new EFAProvider
myprovider, err := goefa.ProviderFromJson("avv")

// Find a stop by name
idtfd, stops, err := myprovider.FindStop("KÃ¶nigsplatz")

// If stop was identified get the 5 next departures
deps, err := stops[0].Departures(time.Now(), 5)
```
